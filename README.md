# Project Overview

In this project, we embarked on an in-depth exploration of Disney's cinematic history. Utilizing the power of Jupyter Notebook and Python, we meticulously cleaned our dataset, ensuring it was primed for analysis. Our data spanned years of Disney's filmography, providing a rich tapestry of information to delve into.

# Data Visualization with PowerBI

With our data cleaned, we turned to PowerBI to bring our data to life. We created a comprehensive dashboard that served as a window into Disney's illustrious past. This interactive tool allowed us to visualize various aspects of Disney's movies, from their popularity to their financial success.

# Key Insights

One of the key features of our dashboard was the ability to identify the best Disney movies throughout the years. This was determined through a combination of factors such as MPAA Rating, Total Gross, and box office performance.

Additionally, our dashboard highlighted the top three movies in terms of gross income. This insight provided a glimpse into the commercial success of Disney movies and offered a benchmark for financial performance in the film industry.

# Additional Findings

But our analysis didn't stop there. Our dashboard was teeming with insights, each one shedding light on a different facet of Disney's cinematic journey. From genre trends to the evolution of animation styles, our project painted a vivid picture of Disney's impact on the film industry.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this project was a testament to the power of data analysis and visualization. By harnessing the capabilities of Python and PowerBI, we were able to transform raw data into meaningful insights, providing a deeper understanding of Disney's cinematic legacy. This project underscores the potential of data science and business intelligence in driving informed decision-making and strategy development.
